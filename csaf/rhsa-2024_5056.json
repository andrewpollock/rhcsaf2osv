Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.\n\nThe described SQL injection vulnerability, while significant, is categorized as important rather than critical due to several factors. Firstly, the exploitation relies on specific conditions, including the use of a non-default query mode (preferQueryMode=simple) and the precise arrangement of user-controlled parameters within the SQL query. This limits the potential attack surface and reduces the likelihood of widespread exploitation across systems. Additionally, the vulnerability does not pose an immediate and severe risk of system compromise or data breach; rather, it enables attackers to manipulate SQL queries and potentially execute arbitrary commands within the context of the application's database. Furthermore, the vulnerability can be effectively mitigated by applying the provided patch or by avoiding the use of the vulnerable query mode, thus reducing the risk of exploitation.\n\nRed Hat Satellite ships a PostgreSQL JDBC Driver which embeds into Candlepin. However, Candlepin doesn't directly utilize the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver and doesn't set PreferQueryMode. Therefore, although the affected component is shipped, the product impact is considered Low. This issue may be addressed in a future Satellite release.",
